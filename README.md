# cSnake
a small snake program, written in C, made mostly for me to study the functionality of the `ncurses` library.

## Usage
move to the project directory, and run
```sh
$ make
```
this will build the `main` executable in the given diretory, which you can then run to play the snake game.

## Configuration
`main` source file contains a number of preporcessor macros at the start of te file, which can be used to customize the game.
they control the snake behavior if it hits the border, look of the snake and the fruit, and the speed of the game

## Contribution
This project has been made for the purposes of personal study, and is made public in order to provide other students to do so as well.
As such, it can be considered "legacy code", meaning any of the bugfix/feature pull requests will be ignored/closed, though feel free to fork it and make your own changes
